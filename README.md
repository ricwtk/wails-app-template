## About

This template is designed for a multiple app created using Wails with Vue + VueRouter + TailwindCSS + MaterialDesignIcons.

To use this template,
```wails init -n your-project -t https://github.com/ricwtk/wails-app-template```

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
